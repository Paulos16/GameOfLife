# GameOfLife
Implementation of a cellular automaton called Game Of Life with gui made using Swing.

## Further Improvements
* Create a button showing a chart with most used patterns.
* Create a dynamic list for setting rules (underpopulation, overpopulation, reproduction).
* Fix a bug where blocks are stretching when the size is set above 21.
* Make it possible to change game size and rules on the fly.
