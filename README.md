# GameOfLife

## Project Description
Implementation of a cellular automaton called Game Of Life with gui made using Swing.

## Java packages and classes used in the project
* `javax.swing`
* `java.util.concurrent`
* `java.util.stream.IntStream`

## What I've learned from this project
* The usage of Swing (JSpinner, JSlider, SpinnerListModel, Layouts, BorderFactory) to create a user interface that's clean and easy to use.
* ScheduledFuture<?> and ScheduledExecutorService and it's use in invoking methods at a fixed rate.
* Version Control System using Git in IntelliJ Idea.
* Managing GitHub repository.


## Further improvements
* Create a button showing a chart with most used patterns.
* Create a dynamic list for setting rules (underpopulation, overpopulation, reproduction).
* Fix a bug where blocks are stretching when the size is set above 21.
* Make it possible to change game size and rules on the fly.
